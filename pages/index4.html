            Virtual Enterprise 2023-2024: Melting Pint
        </h2>

        <div class = 'one'>
            <img src="design/logo.png" id="logo" style="border-radius: 20";>

            <p> Through multiple drafts and refinements, my VP of Design and 
                I collaborated to create a logo that was applied across all 
                company branding using Ibis Paint and Canva.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class = 'two'>
            <img src="design/color.png" id="color" style="border-radius: 20";>
            <img src="design/mascot.png" id="mascot" style="border-radius: 20";>
    
        </div>
        <p class = 'twoP'>
            Based on company research and feedback, my VP of Design and I 
            developed the brand color palette, using yellow to convey happiness, 
            blue to represent open-mindedness, and purple to evoke comfort. 
            On the right is our company mascot that helped distinguished us from
            competitors.
        </p>


        <div class = 'three'>
            <img src="design/products.png" id="products" style="border-radius: 20";>

            <p>Using Ibis Paint, Canva, and web images, I created the company’s 
                pint designs by combining digital sketching tools with elements 
                sourced online. These designs were then produced as physical 
                prototypes and showcased at our Tradeshow Competitions.
                
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class = 'four'>
            <img src="design/labels.png" id="labels" style="border-radius: 20";>

            <p>
                This is an example of a product label created for the 
                physical prototype of the company’s product.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class = 'five'>
            <img src="design/box.png" id="box" style="border-radius: 20";>

            <p>
                This is Melting Pint’s shipping box. Using Ibis Paint and 
                Canva, I created a layout demonstrating how our ice cream 
                products can be shipped to remain frozen and visually appealing.
            </p>
